# The Superiority of Passkeys in Modern Authentication
### Passkeys vs. Passwords

As the digital landscape evolves, ensuring the security of our online accounts becomes more crucial than ever. Traditional passwords have long been the primary means of authentication, but they suffer from inherent weaknesses such as vulnerability to breaches, brute-force attacks, and password reuse. In contrast, passkeys offer a compelling alternative, providing enhanced security and ease of use. 

This article delves into the concept of passkeys, explores the [FIDO2 authentication](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/) standard, and explains the role of public and private keys in modern authentication.

## What are Passkeys?

A passkey, also known as a [cryptographic](https://wlog.app/posts/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-about-aes-and-love-the-chacha.html#it-also-means-that-it-is-a-worthy-alternative-to-aes-writ-large) key or security key, is a small hardware device used for authentication purposes. Unlike passwords, passkeys rely on public-key cryptography to establish a secure connection between the user and the system. They are typically in the form of USB tokens, smart cards, or Bluetooth-enabled devices.

### FIDO2 and Passkeys

FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online 2.0) is an authentication standard developed by the FIDO Alliance, a consortium of technology companies. The primary goal of FIDO2 is to provide a strong and seamless authentication experience across online services. One of the central components of FIDO2 is the use of passkeys.

The FIDO2 standard embraces two authentication mechanisms: WebAuthn (Web Authentication) and CTAP2 (Client-to-Authenticator Protocol 2). WebAuthn allows web browsers to interact with authenticators (passkeys) to perform passwordless or second-factor authentication. CTAP2, on the other hand, enables communication between the client device and the authenticator.

#### Public and Private Keys

To better understand how passkeys work, it's essential to grasp the concept of public and private keys. Public-key cryptography employs a pair of keys – public and private – to facilitate secure communication and authentication.

- **Public Key:** This key is openly shared and is used for encryption and verification. It is used by others to encrypt data that only the corresponding private key can decrypt.

- **Private Key:** As the name suggests, this key must be kept confidential and secure. It is used to decrypt data encrypted with its associated public key and to sign digital signatures.

#### How Passkeys Enhance Security

- [Eliminating Password Vulnerabilities](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/): Passkeys eliminate the vulnerabilities associated with passwords, such as brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and password reuse. Since the passkey is a physical device, it cannot be replicated or guessed.

- [Phishing Protection](https://www.mimecast.com/content/phishing-protection/): Traditional passwords are susceptible to phishing attacks, where malicious actors attempt to trick users into revealing their credentials. Passkeys are resistant to such attacks as they rely on the presence of the physical device.

- [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://www.rsa.com/multi-factor-authentication/what-is-mfa/): Passkeys are an effective form of MFA. By requiring both something the user knows (e.g., a PIN) and something the user possesses (the passkey), the security of the authentication process is significantly enhanced.

- [Passwordless Authentication](https://www.descope.com/): Passkeys enable passwordless authentication, reducing the burden on users to remember complex passwords while ensuring robust security.

Passkeys represent a significant leap forward in authentication technology, providing stronger security and mitigating many of the vulnerabilities associated with traditional passwords.

With the FIDO2 standard driving the adoption of passkeys, users can experience passwordless or second-factor authentication with increased convenience and peace of mind. As the digital world continues to evolve, embracing passkeys will undoubtedly pave the way for a more secure online experience for users and organizations alike.
